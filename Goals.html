       I originally wanted to make a multiplayer snake game where you can kill people when they hit your body, like slither io. But the time constraint and the complexity of the code prohibits me from doing that. So I made a revised single player game which combines both slither io and Google's snake game. If I have time in the future, I would continue this project and achieve the goals originally planned. <br> The things I planned to learn have been acheived. Like for example classes and windom class, physics engine, camera, etc.
