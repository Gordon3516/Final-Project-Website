            Making the snakes were challenging. I spent a lot of time figuring out how should the body follow the head, and then I figured to use a global variable to store the coordinates. <br> Making the bot is also hard, given consideration to the time, I decided to skip this step and make the snake died if hit itself.<div>
            <h2 style="background-color: rgb(14, 160, 201);"></style>Success</h2></div>
            I am glad to see the program run smoothly, although the project is not as difficult as planned, it is very challenging and explores me to a variety of computer science concepts. 
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(201, 14, 61);"></style>What I learned in PyArcade</h2></div>
            I learned how to make classes, make games using window class, sprites, python syntaxes and logic, and how the functions and list work in python that is different in pyret.
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(179, 201, 14);"></style>Skills I learned</h2></div>
            I learned how to break down the task into smaller pieces and attacking each of them. <br> I learned how to problem solve and work on my critical thinking skills. <br> I also learn to talk out loud when programming to debug, I literally using the duck method when I was coding this morning.
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(151, 14, 201);"></style>Future Improvements</h2></div>
            High score system <br> bot snakes <br> more boost and features <br> loading screen <br> buttons <br> explore more withing python
