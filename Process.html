            This part involves watching a youtube video: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8"> Video</a> <br>
            Also it involves reading a textbook specific to py arcade. Many functions and syntax are learned in these two places. I know how games in python are made, etc
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(201, 14, 61);"></style>Start Programming</h2></div>
            I started progamming by making the outline, like class game, define main, define setup, super function etc, this part is not very hard and I finished quickly.
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(179, 201, 14);"></style>Programming Process</h2></div>
            This part involved making the coins, which I borrowed from the textbook example, and also made walls using the textbook exmaple. Then using the idea of a sprite learned both in Snap and in the pyarcade textbook, I created my player snake. <br> To make the snake move, however, i need the body to follow the head, so I made a list to store the previous coordinates of the head <br> 
            After figuring out that part, I tried making the bots, but after few hours of trying, I decided to detour and create a mixture game between Google snake and snakeio. <br> I created a scoring system and end screen after death. <br> Then I created the boosts. I gave each boost a variable so if the boost is on, the variable shows 1, if it shows 1, something happens, like for example double score. <br> I also keep a glob variable to know how many times the program has looped, so 500 loops later the boost stops. <br>
            Finally I made the code clearer and added some sound.
            <div><h2 style="background-color: rgb(151, 14, 201);"></style>Debugging</h2></div>
            A lot of bugs occured from the program, include some datatype errors, indentation errors etc. <br> In the end, I got faster at identifying them.
