        </div>
        This snake game I made involves controlling a snake to get coins. There are boosts across the map, blue is x2 score, orange is x5 score, yellow is speed up, green is invincibility when hit your self. <br>  Avoid hitting walls which will result in death no matter what, and avoid hitting yourself if invincibility is not on. Once dies, wait 15 second and the game will close itself.

        <h2 style="background-color: rgb(24, 117, 199);"></style>Difference from Tutorial</h2>
        I only borrowed the coin making part, wall making, and sprite making part. The rest I learned the syntax and think of the logic myself.

        Ideas like sprites, lists, functions, iteration are mention in previous units.
